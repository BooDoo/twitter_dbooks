twitter_dbooks is a pre-written twitter_ebooks bot that allows *anyone* to set up their very own anime image tweeting bot. See [@kangaroo_ebooks](https://twitter.com/kangaroo_ebooks) for a fully fledged bot example. I would show you what I did to set it up, but I can't, because literally all the configuration it required involved typing in a bunch of secret API codes.

## Installation
Coming soon! If you've already set up a twitter bot before, you can probably figure it out by clicking on Deploy to Heroku above. Really. It's amazingly simple.
