This is [@kangaroo_ebooks](https://twitter.com/kangaroo_ebooks)'s source. It uses twitter_ebooks v2. While it does have some customization available, I didn't really make this with the intention of actually using it for multiple bots. It doesn't really work for any cases other than tag searches where posts are constantly being added, and it's extremely user-unfriendly! I'm planning to write a new version updating it to twitter_ebooks v3 soon, and have that be more customizable.

If you do end up using my code, please let me know on Twitter! I'm [@stawbewwi](https://twitter.com/stawbewwi).
